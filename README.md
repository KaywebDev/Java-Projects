# Java-Projects
Just some of my projects that I wrote using Java

-Project 2: prompts for two integers from the keyboard and prints their sum, their product, the larger number, and the smaller number on the screen.

-Project 4: A weekly payroll program that prompts the user for the number of hours an employee worked, as well as the employee’s pay rate.
 The progrm then checks if the employee works for 40 hours or less, if so, the gross pay is calculated by multiplying the number of 
hours worked by the pay rate. If the number of hours worked by the employee exceeds 40 hours, but is less than 50 
hours, the employee will receive regular pay for the first 40 hours, and receive time-and-a-half pay for the hours in 
excess of 40. If the number of hours worked by the employee exceeds 50 hours, the employee will receive regular 
pay for the first 40 hours, receive time-and-a-half pay for the hours in excess of 40, and double pay for the hours in 
excess of 50. The program then displays each employee’s calculated gross pay (to 2 places of decimal) with an appropriate
label.

-Project 5: A program that calculates and displays (to 2 places of decimal) the weekly Gross Pay of a regular employees and temporary employees.
If a regular employee works for 40 hours or less, the weekly gross pay is calculated
by multiplying the number of hours worked by the pay rate. If the number of hours 
worked exceeds 40 hours, the employee should receive regular pay for the first 40 
hours, and receive time-and-a-half pay for the hours in excess of 40.
The weekly gross pay of a temp employee is calculated by multiplying the number of hours
worked by the pay rate, regardless of the number of hours worked.

-Project 6: A program that calculates and displays (to 2 places of decimal) the weekly gross pay of salaried employees, hourly employees, Contract workers, 
Consultants, and Interns.

-Project 7: A program that creates an Array and populates it with 10 randomly generated unique integers. Displays the 10 unsorted list of random numbers. Then, display all 10 numbers again, sorted in ascending order.

-Project 8: A program that calculates and displays (to 2 places of decimal) the weekly
gross pay of an hourly employee. The gross pay of an Hourly employee is 
calculated as follows: If the number of hours worked by the employee is 40 hours 
or less, the gross pay is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by 
the pay rate. If the number of hours worked by the employee exceeds 40 hours, 
the employee will receive regular pay for the first 40 hours, and receive time-and a-half pay for the hours in excess of 40. The employee must not work more than 
50 hours per week and the Pay Rate must not exceed $85.00.

-Project 9: CommissionEmployee and BasePlusCommissionEmployee Inheritance project. This project was to demonstrate Inheritance by creating a new employee object
from an existing class. The BPACETest.java file tests the basic functions of the two classes.
